    Work individually on particular Nodes
    Start explaining our functionality
    Wedge individual code together
    Bug fixing and program sprucing

PAST OBJECTIVES:

SHARED INFORMATION:
WHAT FOO IN JAVA SHOULD BE IN C++

ONGOING LIST OF AST PARTS WITH DESCRIPTIONS

NOSTALGIC BULLSHIT NONE OF US EVER READ (Including me, the writer)
Since we are still in the planning phase of this project, this README will also
act as a discussion and organization page for everyone within the group. We
will be continuing to list off objectives, questions, and comments here for the
time being.

WHAT WE LEARNED IN CLASS 9/15
    2 choices for structure representation
        General Node may be preferable for the first semester
            One visitor class(es) vs. type by type class
    2 choices for functionality structures

OBJECTIVES FOR THE WEEKEND:
    1. Read xtc, especially parser
    2. Start thinking of how it will work, to a flowchart level.
    3. What we will designate to Ver. 1
    4. Expand 4-step system into larger instructions
    5. What to do with the GNode, what to take from XTC
